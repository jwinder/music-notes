# Guitar Key Pattern

_Using the guitar to find notes & chords in a major or natural minor key._

## Review of major scale chords

The chords are defined on the major scale.

| Root  |     2 |     3 |     4 |        5 |     6 |          7 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| major | minor | minor | major | dominant | minor | diminished |

That is, the root note in a given major scale would be a major chord, the second note would be a minor chord, and so on.

Here are examples in the keys of C and F using only triad chords. Reminder that the major scale from a root note is constructed using the formula Root-W-W-H-W-W-W-H.

| C | D  | E  | F | G  | A  | B    |
|---|----|----|---|----|----|------|
| C | Dm | Em | F | G  | Am | Bdim |

| F | G  | A  | B♭ | C | D  | E    |
|---|----|----|----|---|----|------|
| F | Gm | Am | B♭ | C | Dm | Edim |

## Finding the major scale chords

Here is a major scale pattern on the low E and A strings, given a root note R:

| E | A |
|---|---|
| 6 | 2 |
| - | - |
| 7 | 3 |
| R | 4 |
| - | - |
| - | 5 |

Here are the types of chord associated with each degree:

| E   | A |
|-----|---|
| m   | m |
| -   | - |
| dim | m |
| M   | M |
| -   | - |
| -   | M |

That is, given a root note R, the M (major) chords are the notes associated with:

 - root note on the E string
 - the note below it on the A string
 - the note 1 whole step above the note on the A string.

The m (minor) chord notes follow the same pattern except starting with the note on the E string 3 half steps below the root note (the relative minor of the root note).

The dim (diminished) chord in the key is associated with the note a single half step below the root note on the E string.

### Major scale examples

Consider the root note of G

| E  | A |
|----|---|
| E  | A |
| -  | - |
| F♯ | B |
| G  | C |
| -  | - |
| -  | D |

The major chords are G, C, and D. The minor chords are Emin, Amin, and Bmin. The diminished chord if F♯dim.

The G major scale is G A B C D E F♯.

Now, Consider the root note of G♯ (ignoring double-sharps)

| E  | A  |
|----|----|
| F  | B♭ |
| -  | -  |
| G  | C  |
| G♯ | C♯ |
| -  | -  |
| -  | D♯ |

The major chords are G♯, C♯, and D♯. The minor chords are Fmin, B♭min, and Cmin. The diminished chord is Gdim.

The G♯ major scale is: G♯ B♭ C C♯ D♯ F G.

## Natural minor scale chords

The natural minor scale for a root note R has the same notes and chords as R's relative major note's major scale, where the relative major of R is 3 half steps above R.

Recall the major scale for G (G A B C D E F♯):

| E  | A |
|----|---|
| E  | A |
| -  | - |
| F♯ | B |
| G  | C |
| -  | - |
| -  | D |

G is the relative major of E / E is the relative minor of G. The notes in the E minor scale are the same as the G major scale except the root note starts with E instead of G: E F♯ G A B C D.

Recall the chords associated with each note:

| E   | A |
|-----|---|
| m   | m |
| -   | - |
| dim | m |
| M   | M |
| -   | - |
| -   | M |

The chords for the E minor scale are the same as the chords for the G major scale. The major chords are G, C, and D. The minor chords are Emin, Amin, and Bmin. The diminished chord is F♯dim.

This pattern works for any relative major/minor pair.

The pattern for the minor scale starts at a different root note even though it has the same notes:

| E | A |
|---|---|
| R | 4 |
| - | - |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3 | 6 |
| - | - |
| - | 7 |

From this, the minor scale formula scale is derived as Root-W-H-W-W-H-W-W.

And here are the chords for the minor scale based on the root note.

| Root  |          2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |        7 |
|-------|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| minor | diminished | major | minor | minor | major | dominant |

## Adding the 7th

- Each major chord maps to a major 7th chord.
- The dominant chord maps to a 7th chord (dominant 7th).
- The minor chords map to minor 7th chords.
- The diminished chord maps to a minor 7 flat 5 chord.

| E      | A    |
|--------|------|
| min7   | min7 |
| -      | -    |
| min7♭5 | min7 |
| maj7   | maj7 |
| -      | -    |
| -      | 7    |

Here is the major scale pattern.

| Root |    2 |    3 |    4 | 5 |    6 |      7 |
|------|------|------|------|---|------|--------|
| maj7 | maj7 | min7 | min7 | 7 | min7 | min7♭5 |

Here is the natural minor scale pattern.

| Root |      2 |    3 |    4 |    5 |    6 | 7 |
|------|--------|------|------|------|------|---|
| min7 | min7♭5 | maj7 | min7 | min7 | maj7 | 7 |
