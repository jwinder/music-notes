# Guitar Scale and Chord Shapes

This is an overview of random notes I have for constructing chords, meant to be a reference.

## E Shape Barre Chords

The following chords are rooted on the low E string using the E major scale pattern. In the following table format, each column is a string, and each row is a fret.

| E | A | D | G | B | e |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 | 3 | 6 | 2 | - | 7 |
| R | 4 | - | - | 5 | R |
| - | - | 7 | 3 | - | - |
| 2 | 5 | R | 4 | 6 | 2 |

A lot of these notes are written from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LV-WpHGmL8

### E Shape Major Chord

Example: F or Fmaj. R-3-5 notes in the scale.

Have a look at the F barre chord. This example is a major chord on the first fret, making it an F major chord.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/F.png?p=133211&f=134211&s=2)

 The first finger is barred on the string with the root note (covering the root, the 4th, and the 5th). The second finger is placed on the 3rd. The third finger is placed on the 5th (taking over from the 4th on the barre). The fourth finger is placed on the root (taking over from the note 6 sharp on the barre).

Therefore, only the root, 3rd, and 5th are covered in this chord, making it a standard major chord.

The chord name is that of the root note. This is the bass note or the thickest string played. The first fret on the low E string is the F string, making this an F chord. If the entire shape is moved to the second fret, then this is an F sharp barre chord. The third fret: G barre chord. Etc.

Chords without open strings like this are called _movable chords_ because the same shape can travel up and down the neck. As long as an open string is not played, the chord is movable. Every chord in this document is movable except for the open chords section.

Small clarification: it is possible for a chord to be played where the bass note is not the root note of the scale. Sometimes these are easier fingering positions. They are called _inversions_. A major chord is made up of the three notes R-3-5 of the scale, where the bass note is the R note. When the bass note played is the 3rd, then the chord is denoted as R/3 and called the _first inversion of R_. If the 5th is the bass note: R/5 is the _second inversion of R_.

For example, the following is a common fingering of the F chord where the bass note is C. It is F/C or the second inversion of F. We can see that C is the 5th of F by looking at the scale shape. Notice that the low E string is not played as an open string, it is muted.

### 5 Chord / Power Chord

Example: F5. Uses only the root and 5 of the chord, i.e. it is the R-5 notes in the scale.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/F5.png?p=133xxx&f=134---&s=2)

Observe that the fourth finger is optional as it is the R note, just like the first finger. Therefore, only the low two strings are actually required to complete the R-5 notes, and they would be a fine 5 chord, but three strings provides a more full sound.

### E Shape (Dominate) 7 Chord

Example: F7 or Fdom7. Adds the 7 flat to the chord, i.e. it is the R-3-5-♭7 notes in scale.

### E Shape (Dominate) 9 Chord

Example: F9 or Fdom9. Adds the 7 flat and the 9 flat to the chord, i.e. it is the R-3-5-♭7-♭9 notes in scale. The 9 flat coincides with the 2 flat in the scale.

### E Shape Major 6 Chord

Example: Fmaj6. Adds the 6 to the chord, i.e. R-3-5-6.

This example is rooted on F sharp instead of F, making if F♯maj6, because the 6 of the scale is one fret down from the root. For Fmaj6, the 6 is playable as an open string.

### E Shape Major 7 Chord

Example: Fmaj7. Adds the 7 to the chord, i.e. R-3-5-7.

This first fingering mutes the A string.

Alternative fingering that plays the 5 on the A string.

### E Shape Major 9 Chord

Example: Fmaj9. Adds the 7 and 9 to the chord, i.e. R-3-5-7-9. The 9 coincides with the 2.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/Fmaj9.png?p=1x2213&f=1-2314&s=2)

### E Shape Major 11 Chord

Example: Fmaj11. Adds the 7, 9, and 11 to the chord, i.e. R-3-5-7-9-11. The 11 coincides with the 4.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/Fmaj11.png?p=112213&f=112314&s=2)

### E Shape Minor Chord

Example: Fmin or Fm. A minor chord consists of a flat 3, i.e. R-♭3-5 notes in the scale.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/Fmin.png?p=133111&f=134111&s=2)

### E Shape Minor 6 Chord

Example: Fmin6 or Fm6. Adds the flat 6, i.e. R-♭3-5-6 notes in the scale.

The 6 is one fret down from the root, so this example uses F sharp.

### E Shape Minor 7 Chord

Example: Fmin7 or Fm7. Adds the flat 7, i.e. R-♭3-5-♭7 notes in the scale.

![](http://chordgenerator.net/Fmin7.png?p=131111&f=131111&s=2)

### E Shape Minor 9 Chord

Example: Fmin9 or Fm9. Adds the flat 9, i.e. R-♭3-5-♭7-♭9 notes in the scale.

## A Shape Barre Chords

Here is the original video for this section: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI4qplX7DLs

## Open Chords

The open chords are special cases of guitar chord patterns where the barre finger would coincide with the nut; therefore, the player is allowed to use simplified finger patterns and play with open strings. The open E major open chord falls out of the E scale shape (easy pattern for rooting chords on the low E). The open A major open chord falls out of the A scale shape (easy pattern for rooting chords on the A). The C, D, and G major open chords fall out of their own major scale shapes as well, but those are not included in the above patterns.
